def calculate_demographic_parity(list_of_dataframes, men_total, women_total):
    '''
    Calculates and returns the demographic parity for as many phenotypes as given (A, B, C, etc).
    Quoting the PAKDD lecture, the fundamental idea is that the proportion of each protected class 
    should receive the positive (and negative) outcomes at equal rates. 
    Let class 0 be men (8507), class 1 be women (8532).
    
    Input:
        list_of_dataframes - List of Pandas dataframes queried from a server [for example, for first dataframe:
            sql_query_string = 'select * from dbo.results.disease_demographics where cohort_definition_id = XYZ'
            dataframe_1 = pd.io.sql.read_sql(sql_query_string, conn)]
        men_total - Int, number of men in total in the dataframe
        women_total - Int, number of women total in the dataset

        diffs - List of floats of demographic parities

def calculate_equality_of_opportunity(list_of_dataframes, cohort_definition_ids):
    '''
    Calculates and returns the equality of opportunity for as many phenotypes as given (A, B, C, etc).
    Again quoting the PAKDD lecture, equalized odds is when the predicted output of the model is independent of
    the protected attribute conditional on the data. This definition is restrictive because itâ€™s hard to
    calculate conditional independence, so there is instead a relaxed version (also known as the Equality of
    Opportunity) which is used instead. We need the true definitions. In this case, the true cases are majority
    class for the phenotypes, or the set of patients that are in the majority of cases.
